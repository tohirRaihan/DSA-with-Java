        DS[Data Structure] --> P[Primitive] & NP[Non-Primitive]
        P --> Integer
        P --> Float
        P --> Character
        P --> Boolean
        NP --> L[Linear] & NL[Non Linear]
        L --> S[Static] & D[Dynamic]
        S --> Array
        D --> LL[Linked List]
        D --> Stack
        D --> Queue
        NL --> Tree
        NL --> Graph
